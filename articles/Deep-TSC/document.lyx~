\begin_layout Abstract
Time Series Classification (TSC) has attracted a growing interest over the
 past years.
 Distance-based approaches such as the 1-Nearest-Neighbor (1-NN) classifier
 with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or constructing Time Series Ensembles (TSE)
 merging several distance measures remain the leading methods for TSC.
 However, the computational complexity of TSE makes them intractable for
 larger real-life datasets.
 Up to now, machine learning approaches applied to TSC have been mostly
 unsuccessful because of their inability to handle the 
\emph on
curse of dimensionnality
\emph default
.
 In this paper, we provide the first evidence that carefully trained models
 of 
\emph on
deep learning 
\emph default
can successfully be applied to univariate time series classification.
 By benchmarking an extensive set of simple models and analyzing several
 of their properties, we show that these methods can provide a new leap
 in both 
\emph on
accuracy, computational efficiency 
\emph default
and also 
\emph on
interpretability
\emph default
.
 By comparing various parameter settings and network structures, we demonstrate
 that the architecture of these networks is the most critical component
 to their overall success.
 We show that these approaches are the first to 
\emph on
significantly
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
critically 
\emph default
outperform all previous state-of-art methods on both the complete UCR archive
 and an overall collection of 75 time series datasets.
 Furthermore, these enhanced accuracies are obtained for only a small fraction
 of the computational cost.
 We also show that deep networks implicitly perform a simultaneous assessment
 of time series motifs discovery, even across a large number of heterogeneous
 datasets.
 We hope that this paper open new avenues of research for deep learning
 applied to time series data mining.

 Given sets of labeled time series belonging to different classes, the TSC
 task aims at training a classifier in order to label new time series of
 unknown class.
 An early approach to TSC was presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bakshi1994representation"

\end_inset

 and since then, a variety of approaches have been applied to this topic
 ranging from 1-NN 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xi2006fast"

\end_inset

 to more complex statistical models such as Auto-Regressive Moving Average
 (ARMA) or Hidden Markov Models (HMM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhong2002hmms"

\end_inset

.
 In the context of TSC, it has been shown that the 1-NN classifier is extremely
 hard to overpower 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "xi2006fast"

\end_inset

.
 Several studies subsequently confirmed that the DTW-based 1-NN classification
 remained the best performing TSC method for almost a decade 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gudmundsson2008support,radovanovic2010hubs,ding2008querying"

\end_inset

.
 This comes from the fact that time series are inherently high-dimensional
 data.
 Therefore, it is very difficult to devise statistical methods that can
 avoid this 
\emph on
curse of dimensionality
\emph default
.
 Recently, the idea of building 
\emph on
time series ensembles 
\emph default
(TSE) of classifiers based on multiple distance measures has been proposed
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lines2014time"

\end_inset

, where the classification decision is based on a weighted sum of these.
 This method was shown to provide a significant improvement in accuracy
 over the 1-NN with DTW classifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several drawbacks can be outlined from the literature in TSC research.
 First, despite recurrent efforts in the definition of novel distance measures,
 most seem to be converging towards pervasive performance ceilings which
 stands under satisfactory accuracies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ding2008querying"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, most distance measures introduced in the past years are still outperform
ed by the 30-years old DTW approach 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "berndt1994using"

\end_inset

.
 This can be related to the sub-optimality and limitations of hand-designing
 distance measures.
 Indeed, manually crafted distances are inherently limited, if not only
 by the knowledge of their designer, but also in their restricted ability
 to generalize and adapt to different problems and datasets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "humphrey2013feature"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, current classification systems are restricted to shallow 2-layers
 (compare patterns and match) architectures which are inherently limited.
 The idea of TSE provides a gain in accuracy as it adds a layer of processing
 (merging various distances) prior to class selection.
 This seems to confirm the general idea that depth of the classifying architectu
re might be crucial to its success.
 However, it requires the computation a set of (
\emph on
quadratic
\emph default
 or even 
\emph on
cubic
\emph default
) distance measures against the complete
\emph on
 
\emph default
training dataset, which makes it impracticable for most real-life applications
 both in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, the field of 
\emph on
deep learning 
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 has witnessed a flourishing interest amongst the machine learning community.
 Its goal is to train connexionist architectures analoguous to the well-known
 neural networks.
 However, the typical feed-forward perceptrons are usually bound to small
 depth (number of layers) because of the 
\emph on
gradient diffusion 
\emph default
problem that lead to inefficient learning in deeper networks.
 The recent breakthrough of 
\emph on
greedy layer-wise pre-training
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bengio2007greedy"

\end_inset

 allows to train each layer of the network independently and in an unsupervised
 manner.
 This leads to various types of architectures such as 
\emph on
deep belief networks 
\emph default
that can display an extensive number of layers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hinton2006fast"

\end_inset

, similar to those found in the brain for perceptual task such as visual
 or auditory processing.
 This approach appears as a valid candidate to learn AI models that could
 bypass the

, but also to learn automatically higher-level abstractions fit to various
 problems of time series data mining as exhibited in Figure

 Our goal was to rely solely on the simplest deep learning models and show
 that by carefully investigating and adapting their architecture, properties

 obtain extremely powerful time series data mining methods.
 We investigated the major deep learning algorithms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and compared the probabilistic and computational view over these connexionnist
 architectures.
 For all of the benchmarked models, we analyzed different variants, types
 of computation units and influence of various learning parameters on the
 success of these approaches.
 Finally, we extensively studied the impact of various architecture shapes
 (connection patterns) and depth of the networks.
 In this, we show that the architecture and its shape are of paramount importanc
e to the success of learning.

 We further show that these classifiers outperform all competing approaches

on the complete 46 UCR time series datasets

 and the additional 29 datasets used for evaluating time series ensembles
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, relying on deep networks provides several paramount advantages
 over existing approaches.
 First, regarding computational complexity, the computations required for
 classification consist in a single forward pass through the network.
 Therefore, it is independent of the size of the training set and can also
 easily be applied in real-time or streaming situations.
 Finally, the computational units in deep learning provide an extremely
 more significant interpretability by providing a direct access to automatically
 learned time series motifs.
 Hence, we provide evidence that this approach can simultaneously lead to
 powerful time series motif discovery mechanisms without any additionnal
 computations.
 By feeding various unifromly warped versions of the series, we can simultaneous
ly discover (through learning) and detect (through activations) of the motifs
 with obtained correlations implied by each computation unit.

An ideal time series distance measure should be robust to distortions such

 Hence, a similarity measure should be consistent with human intuition and

 for similarity measures.

Time series classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of TSC is to assign labels to a set of time series of unknown classes,
 given a training set of series with known classes.
 The idea is first to learn what are the distinctive 
\emph on
features
\emph default
 that distinguish classes apart from each other.
 Then, when an unlabeled set is input to the system, it can try to automatically
 assign each series to one class from the set of predefined classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An early approach to time series classification was proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bakshi1994representation"

\end_inset

.
 However, it was based on simple trends whose results are therefore hard
 to apply to more complex data.
 A piecewise representation was later proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "keogh1998enhanced"

\end_inset

 which provides robustness to noise but also allows relevance feedback.
 To overcome the obstacle of high dimensionality, Jeng and Huang 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jeng2008time"

\end_inset

 used Singular Value Decomposition to select essential frequencies.
 However, it implies higher computational costs.
 Several other techniques have been introduced, such as Hidden Markov Models
 (HMM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhong2002hmms"

\end_inset

, which can be enhanced by using discriminative HMMs in order to maximize
 inter-classes differences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Several machine-learning techniques have also been introduced such as Neural
 Networks or Bayesian classification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bagnall2012transformation"

\end_inset

.
 However, all of these proposals have been repeatedly shown to be overpowered
 by a simple 1NN-DTW classifier 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "xi2006fast"

\end_inset

 in terms of accuracy (while computing speed is significantly affected by
 repeated DTW computations).
 Recently, the idea of building time series 
\emph on
ensembles 
\emph default
has been proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lines2014time"

\end_inset

.
 This approach computes a whole set of distance measures and performs the
 classification decision based on a weighted sum of these measures.
 This method was shown to outperform previous state-of-art approaches and
 will be used as a baseline for comparison in our experiments.
 However, it should be noted that this method implies a very heavy computational
 cost, as it requires to compute several (quadratic or even cubic) distance
 measures against the 
\emph on
complete 
\emph default
training dataset (which might also be kept in live memory).
 Therefore, even though this approach provides an increased classification
 accuracy, it appears impracticable for most real-life applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As listed in the previous section, a variety of distance measures have been
 devised but all seem to converge towards performance ceilings.
 The only advance in TSC accuracy comes from merging several distance measures
 which is computationally inefficient.
 This points out to a limitation in hand-crafted distance measures.
 Finally, the apparent inadequacy of machine learning approaches for TSC
 problems stems from their inability to handle the curse of dimensionality.
 All these problems are directly addressed by the recent advances in deep
 learning, which is yet to be applied adequatly to univariate TSC.

Deep learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of deep learning is to construct neural networks (similar to the
 well-known multi-layer perceptron) but with a deeper architecture (higher
 number of layers).
 The general idea is that with multiple hidden layers, each provides increasingl
y higher-level and complex features over the input by uncovering correlations
 through non-linear transformations of the previous layer.
 Although this idea of depth was long-going in the neural network community,
 training seemed infeasible because of the gradient diffusion problem.
 However, the recent breakthrough of
\emph on
 unsupervised layer-wise pre-training
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bengio2007greedy"

\end_inset

 allows to learn each layer at a time, by training each layer to minimize
 the reconstruction of the hidden representation output by the previous
 layer.
 Furthermore, this also provides a way to train the networks in a purely
 unsupervised manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, two interpretations can be given to these connexionnist architectures.
 First, the probabilistic view lead to models driven by probabilistic graphical
 models, interpreting the hidden units as latent random variables.
 Second, the computational view following neural networks lead to model
 constructed through computation graphs, where hidden units are considered
 as computational nodes.
 These two views are not entirely dichotomic as their similarities seem
 to outweigh their differences and can in fact become almost equivalent
 under certain assumptions

, where an encoder provides a reduced (compressed) representation of the
 input, while a decoder allows to reconstruct the orginal input from this
 encoded representation.
 The main idea is that if you are able to deconstruct an object in fewer
 components and then reconstruct it, you are grasping some aspects of its
 inner structure.
 Hence, it tries to exploit statistical correlations inside the data to
 find a higher-level representation by decomposing and then reconstructing
 the input, as depicted in Figure

 The goal is to ensure that hidden units are mostly inactive for a large

 By computing the average activation of each hidden unit 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 across the dataset 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hat{\rho}_{i}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left[a_{i}(\mathbf{x}_{j})\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

we can add a penalty term to the objective that penalizes the unit which
 mean activation 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle \hat{\rho}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 deviates from a 
\emph on
target
\emph default
 sparsity 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle \rho}$

 This is achieved by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between
 all 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle \hat{\rho}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 and the target 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the complete cost function is defined by the sum of the normal
 cost function and this sparsity constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\mathcal{J}_{{\rm sparse}}\left(\theta\right)=\mathcal{J}\left(\theta\right)+\beta\sum_{i}{\rm KL}\left(\rho,\hat{\rho}_{i}\right)

 controls the influence of the sparsity on the global cost.
 Overcomplete sparse AEs can be seen as an attempt to learn a series of

Denoising auto-encoders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another successful way to regularize AEs is the concept of Denoising Auto-Encode
rs (DAE) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vincent2010stacked"

\end_inset

.
 Intuitively, the idea is to corrupt the input 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 to obtain
\series bold
 
\series default
a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noisy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$
\end_inset

 that is passed to the AE, but the goal of the network is to reconstruct
 the original (clean) version of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 (producing an overall denoising process).
 Training the autoencoder to reconstruct a clean input from a corrupted
 version of itself forces the hidden layer to uncover robust features but
 also inherently prevents it from learning the identity function.
 Hence, the objective function for the DAE is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{J}_{DAE}\left(\theta\right)=\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{D}_{n}}\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\sim q\left(\mathbf{x}\mid\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\right)}\left[\mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{x},d\left(e\left(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\right)\right)\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the corrupted versions 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$
\end_inset

 are obtained by applying a stochastic function 
\begin_inset Formula $q\left(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\mid\mathbf{x}\right)$
\end_inset

 to the examples 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The corruption processes are typically additive Gaussian noise and binary
 masking (a randomly selected subset of input components are set to 0).
 Variable amounts of corruption (variance of the Gaussian noise or number
 of dropped components) can be considered to control the degree of regularizatio
n.

 have been proposed.
 The main idea is to add a penalty based on the derivative of the representation
 with respect to the input.
 This encourages the learned features to have low variations in the directions
 found in the data.
 This penalty term can be computed through the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian
 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{e}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the activations with respect to the input.
 Formally, given an input 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{x}}$
\end_inset

 mapped to a hidden representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}}$
\end_inset

, the contractive penalty term is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\Vert J_{e}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\right\Vert _{F}^{2}=\sum_{ij}\left(\frac{\partial h_{j}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)}{\partial x_{i}}\right)^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{d_{h}}\left(h_{i}\left(1-h_{i}\right)\right)^{2}\sum_{j=1}^{d_{x}}W_{ij}^{2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While DAEs (indirectly) encourages the robustness of the reconstruction
 through corruption, CAEs tries to analytically encourage the robustness
 of the representation itself by penalizing its variations in the neighborhood
 of training points.
 One problem with the penalty introduced by CAE is that it might be limited
 to only 
\emph on
infinitesimal 
\emph default
variations in the input (because of the use of the first-order derivative).
 An extension to all higher-order derivatives has been proposed

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multi-layer stacking and perceptrons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DAE and RBM models are the building blocks of deep networks in which
 a single layer of hidden activations provides the set of learned features.
 However, the goal of deep networks is to learn a structured hierarchy,
 based on the hypothesis that higher-level concepts can be formed by grouping
 lower-level ones.
 Hence, each layer forms increasingly complex features by exploiting the
 statistical regularities and learning how to optimally group lower-level
 concepts formed at the previous layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, we could construct a deep network by stacking these single-layer
 models and feeding the hidden representation of a specific layer as input
 to its following layer.
 In that case, the stacked layers can be interpreted as a traditional 
\emph on
Multi-Layer Perceptron
\emph default
 (MLP).
 After all layers have been trained iteratively, the full network is trained
 through a 
\emph on
fine-tuning
\emph default
 step, usually by minimizing the error rate of a supervised task.
 In that case, a classification layer can be added on top of the network
 in order to perform back-propagation on all layers of the network (which
 makes it exactly similar to the learning procedure of a traditional MLP).

Stacked auto-encoders

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{W}_{e}^{(l)}$
\end_inset

 and bias vector 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{e}^{(l)}$
\end_inset

 The output (activation) of each layer is produced by performing a forward
 pass of the encoding step from one layer to the next
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a^{(l)} & = & \phi\left(\mathbf{W}_{e}^{(l-1)}\mathbf{a}^{(l-1)}+b_{e}^{(l-1)}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

by considering that the first layer receives the output 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{(0)}=\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The stacked auto-encoder ultimately produces a representation 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{(n)}$
\end_inset

 (activations of the deepest hidden units), which can be seen as the highest-ord
er features extracted from the input.
 These can be used for classification problems which allow to perform a
 finetuning of this deep model.
 The error gradients from the supervised classification can then be backpropagat
ed into all the encoding layers together.
 This global network can thus be trained altogether by improving upon the
 weights of all layers at each iteration.

 Hence, stacking layers of RBMs from the lowest (

\emph on

 In that case, we consider that the activation probabilities of the hidden
 layer of one RBM becomes the visible data for the next RBM layer.
 It has been shown that this stacking procedure improves the variational
 lower bound of the data log-likelihood

.
 First, we evaluate both AE and RBM as single-layer models.
 Once these are pre-trained following a specific architecture (topology
 of connexions, detailed in the following section), we add a logistic classifier
 layer and evaluate their classification accuracy by considering the whole
 network as an MLP.
 These models are simply termed AE and RBM in the following.
 For the AE, we further tested its various regularizations, by comparing
 both DAE and CAE with the same parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we investigate more advanced multi-layer models, based on the same
 pre-trained layers.
 Hence, after the pre-training operation, we instantiate an SAE, DBM or
 DBN (depending on whether the pre-trained layers are AE or RBM).
 All the models are summarized in Table

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Architectures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture of the network can be of crucial importance, but is also
 a complex set of parameters that can hardly be driven by the data.
 Three major factors come into play regarding the architecture of connexions
 inside the network.
 First, the 
\emph on
depth 
\emph default
of the network is defined by the number of layers it contains.
 Second, the 
\emph on
width 
\emph default
of the network is defined by the number of units contained in the layers.
 Finally, the 
\emph on
topology 
\emph default
of the network can be loosely defined as the relative size of layers from
 one to another.
 We delineated four major categories, namely 
\emph on
linear, increasing
\emph default
, 
\emph on
decreasing 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
bottleneck
\emph default
.
 In order to test various combinations of parameters, we instantiated a
 set of architectures detailed in Table

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Computational units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding computational units, several choices can be made.
 Primarly, the type of uits is conditionned by whether the variables are
 considered as being real or binary.
 As we are dealing with time series data, the visible layer is always considered
 as a set of real units (as binary data would not have much meaning in our
 case).
 Then, we evaluate the hidden parts of the networks as being either entirely
 composed of binary units or entirely composed of real units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, several types of computational units (activation function)
 can be used in each neuron.
 To evaluate this aspect, we compare the use of 
\emph on
sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent 
\emph default
(tanh)
\emph on
 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
rectified linear 
\emph default
(relu) units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Learning parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the models have a wide variety of learning parameters (called hyper-para
meters), we evaluated the setting of these by using a combination of random
 search and kernel approximation.

Statistical significance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on our evaluation framework, we obtain the error rates for each classifier
 over every datasets.
 However, as noted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "salzberg1997comparing"

\end_inset

, there are several pitfalls to avoid when comparing classifiers.
 Therefore, in order to assess the relative performances of various classifiers,
 we compute the statistical significance of these results by following the
 recommendations of Salzberg 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "salzberg1997comparing"

\end_inset

 and Demsar 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "demvsar2006statistical"

\end_inset

.
 First, we avoid the 
\emph on
multiplicity effect 
\emph default
by relying on the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test
 over the results of Friedman's ANOVA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "demvsar2006statistical"

\end_inset

.
 Then, we use a post-hoc Nemenyi test to exhibit the critical differences
 that might exist between classifiers.
 Finally, we present the 
\emph on
critical difference graphs 
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which show the statistical differences and eventual cliques of statistical
 equivalence between various methods.
